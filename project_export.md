<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

## .git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample

```text
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

## .git/hooks/sendemail-validate.sample

```text
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to validate a patch (and/or patch series) before
# sending it via email.
#
# The hook should exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate
# message if it wants to prevent the email(s) from being sent.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "sendemail-validate".
#
# By default, it will only check that the patch(es) can be applied on top of
# the default upstream branch without conflicts in a secondary worktree. After
# validation (successful or not) of the last patch of a series, the worktree
# will be deleted.
#
# The following config variables can be set to change the default remote and
# remote ref that are used to apply the patches against:
#
#   sendemail.validateRemote (default: origin)
#   sendemail.validateRemoteRef (default: HEAD)
#
# Replace the TODO placeholders with appropriate checks according to your
# needs.

# Copilot / Agent Instructions for Fibonnaci Benchmark

Quick, actionable notes to get an AI coding agent productive in this repository.

1) Big-picture architecture
- **Orchestrator (Go)**: `orchestrator/` runs an HTTP server + WebSocket hub and owns RabbitMQ orchestration. Entry: `orchestrator/cmd/server/main.go`.
- **Workers**: language-specific worker folders at `worker-go/`, `worker-node/`, `worker-python/`, `worker-rust/`. Each worker connects to RabbitMQ and participates in the benchmark.
- **Message bus**: RabbitMQ is the central integration point. Key code: `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/rabbitmq.go`.
- **UI**: static files and client code under `orchestrator/internal/api/web/` and WebSocket hub in `orchestrator/internal/api/hub.go`.
- **Compose / orchestration**: `compose.yml` defines services, environment variables and network `fibo-benchmark-network`.

2) Core dataflows & conventions (must-follow)
- Worker registration: workers announce themselves to queue `isReady` (see `ListenForWorkers()` in `rabbitmq.go`).
- Per-worker result queues follow the pattern `results_{workerID}`. These are created as RabbitMQ streams (queue arg `x-queue-type: stream`). See the `QueueDeclare` call in `rabbitmq.go`.
- Admin sync: a durable fanout exchange `fibo_admin_exchange` is declared for synchronous broadcast across services.
- Durability: queues/exchanges are declared `durable: true` in orchestrator â€” when adding or changing queues follow the same durability/stream semantics to avoid PRECONDITION_FAILED errors.
- Concurrency: orchestrator uses `Engine.Mu` to guard `Channel`/`Workers`. Follow locking patterns when mutating shared Engine state.

3) Important files to reference
- RabbitMQ orchestration: `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/rabbitmq.go`
- Engine and types: `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/types.go`
- WebSocket hub & routes: `orchestrator/internal/api/hub.go`, `orchestrator/internal/api/routes.go` and `orchestrator/internal/api/web/`
- Docker compose: `compose.yml` (service names, env var names like `AMQP_URL_*`, `REDIS_URL`)
- Worker examples: `worker-go/`, `worker-node/`, `worker-python/`, `worker-rust/` (follow folder layout and Dockerfiles)
- Proto definitions: `proto/sync.proto` (check if type generation is needed before cross-language changes)

4) Developer workflows (how to build/run/debug)
- Full stack (recommended): from repo root
  - Build & start: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build --remove-orphans`
  - Tail orchestrator logs: `docker compose logs -f orchestrator`
  - Start a single service: `docker compose up -d orchestrator` or `docker compose up -d fibo-go`
- Local Go iteration (without Docker): set `AMQP_URL` locally then run:
  - `go run ./orchestrator/cmd/server` (or `go build ./...` then run binary)
  - The orchestrator listens on `:8080` and exposes health at `/health`.
- Worker iteration:
  - Go worker: build/run under `worker-go/` (`go run ./cmd/worker`)
  - Node worker: `node worker-node/index.js`
  - Python worker: `python3 worker-python/main.py`
  - Rust worker: `cargo build` / `cargo run` in `worker-rust/`

5) Environment variables and defaults
- `AMQP_URL` (or variants in `compose.yml`: `AMQP_URL_LEADER`, `AMQP_URL_GO`, `AMQP_URL_NODE`, `AMQP_URL_PYTHON`, `AMQP_URL_RUST`) â€” orchestrator falls back to an embedded URL in `orchestrator/cmd/server/main.go` if unset.
- `REDIS_URL` referenced in compose for caching/coordination.

6) When changing message schemas or queues
- Update `proto/sync.proto` first if the change affects message formats used by multiple languages; regenerate stubs if the repo uses codegen (no generator found in repoâ€”confirm with maintainers).
- Keep queue names and durability consistent with `rabbitmq.go` (`isReady`, `results_{id}`, `fibo_admin_exchange`). Streams require declaring `x-queue-type: stream`.

7) Code patterns the agent should follow
- Keep resilient reconnect logic intact: `Engine.InitRabbitMQ` â†’ `handleReconnect` is responsible for reconnection and re-declaring infra.
- Use `Engine.Mu` when accessing `Engine.Channel` or `Engine.Workers`.
- When adding a worker implementation, mirror the `results_{id}` creation and support the `isReady` registration flow.
- Prefer the existing logging style (`log.Printf` with tags like `[RMQ]`, `[SYNC]`, `[WORKER]`).

8) Quick examples (copyable)
- Declare a stream results queue (Go):
```go
args := amqp.Table{"x-queue-type":"stream"}
_, _ = ch.QueueDeclare("results_<id>", true, false, false, false, args)
```
- Broadcast to UI via hub:
```go
hub.BroadcastMessage(map[string]interface{"type": "WORKER_JOIN", "data": reg})
```

9) What the agent should ask the maintainers (if unclear)
- Are stubs generated from `proto/sync.proto` in CI or manually? Where is generation configured?
- Which worker languages are currently considered canonical for benchmarks (the compose file comments indicate some are commented out)?
- Any cluster-specific assumptions (k3s, network addresses) that must be preserved when tweaking reconnect logic?

If anything above is unclear or you want more detail in a specific area (proto/codegen, worker onboarding, Docker/CI), tell me which section to expand. Thanks!
